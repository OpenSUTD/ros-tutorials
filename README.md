# ROS Tutorials

I've compiled a whole bunch of comprehensive tutorials and starter code templates for the **Robot Operating System** (ROS), for both **ROS 1** and **ROS 2**!

Most of these can be read through in under an hour, and they're pitched at the beginner to intermediate level. But most importantly, they're **<u>designed to be CTRL-F-able!</u>**



## Pre-Requisites

It will definitely help to brush up on [Python](https://github.com/methylDragon/coding-notes/tree/master/Python%203) and [C++](<https://github.com/methylDragon/coding-notes/tree/master/C%2B%2B>).

As well as [Linux](<https://github.com/methylDragon/linux-reference>) to be able to follow along with the tutorial.
